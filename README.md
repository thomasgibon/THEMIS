# THEMIS

This repository is aimed at containing scripts, data, and general documentation on the THEMIS database and its various uses.
The main methodology for the database and model development can be found in [the following paper](pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.est.5b01558).

## Regional characterization

In THEMIS, all regions' stressors are assumed to generate the same effect regardless of the location of their emission or occurrence. However, the LCImpact project has derived characterization factor for various regional resolutions worldwide. These factors can be adapted and matched to the THEMIS regions. The "Regional characterisation" folder contains the data files necessary to regionalize the characterization in THEMIS.
